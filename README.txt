= Size It!

Some times surver side you have an image and need to know it's size but but reading the full image is CPU intencive. Then this library is for you. Just read the header information and be done with it!

== Its really simple to use!

get_size('filename.png')
>>> ('image/png', (800, 600))

Yep thats it.
